## TODOLIST

I made this project to keep track of the most important aims for my days.Terms at Dartmouth move so fast that sometimes its really hard to remember important tasks for the day.This TO-DO list uses browser local storage to store image so even if I close the to do list when I reopen it the infomation would be still there.
